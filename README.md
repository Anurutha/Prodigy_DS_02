# Prodigy_DS_02
🎯 Completed: Data Science Internship Task 02
📌 Topic: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
🏢 Internship: Prodigy InfoTech
🧹 Task: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant data, and explore key patterns and relationships through EDA.

🔍 This task helped me:

✔ Understand the importance of data quality in analysis
✔ Apply data preprocessing techniques using Pandas and NumPy
✔ Handle missing, duplicate, and inconsistent data effectively
✔ Perform in-depth EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn
✔ Derive meaningful insights to support data-driven decisions

Looking forward to diving deeper into machine learning and data analysis in the upcoming tasks!
